The question on your mind right now might be... "Why are the view models in the business layer?"

Perhaps it's not the "right" way to do things, so feel free to refactor the project, perhaps using a quick mapper, e.g. 
SimpleMapper (https://bitbucket.org/rolosoft/simplemapper), if you have the time.

For now, however, I wanted to get this done as quickly as possible, and this is just the way it is.
