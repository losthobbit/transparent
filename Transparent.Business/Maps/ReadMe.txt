I was considering using something like AutoMapper, or SimpleMapper, and then I read this...

It reminded me of the days when I was first introduced to automapper and I couldn't understand the point of
using a tool where I could simply say obj1.Prop = obj2.Prop and get design time compiler checking to see
if I was doing anything silly.  

To make things simple, I might not use an automatic mapper.
