        As this website is designed to make group decisions, it doesn't make much sense to
        have contact information here.  You can @Html.ActionLink("post a question or suggestion", "Create", "Ticket")
        and you will be more likely to get a good answer than simply by emailing someone.

        However, until this website becomes massively popular, it may make sense to contact 
        Stephen directly.  If so, you can email him at <script>document.write(generateEmailLink())</script>.
