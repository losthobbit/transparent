    <p>
        The idea for this website comes from the winning essay in the <a href="http://londonfuturists.com/previous-meetings/peace-grand-challenge/">Peace Grand Challenge</a>
        on the subject "Innovative solutions for world peace, 2014-2034."  One of the main features of this site is that it is
        self-improving.  This means that it will start out as something a bit rough, with very little content, and it is up to
        you, as the user, to use the site to create suggestions, argue, vote and volunteer, in order for this site to mature.
    </p>
    <p>
        See <a href ="http://stephenrandom.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/my-peace-grand-challenge-competition.html">my blog</a> for the winning 
        essay, describing how this site works.  For a slightly more in depth article on this project, see <a href="http://transpolitica.org/2015/04/02/democratic-intelligence/">chapter 2</a> of the book, 
        <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Anticipating-tomorrows-politics-Transpolitica-Book-ebook/dp/B00UZ3ELKW">Anticipating Tomorrow's Politics</a></i>, which is <a href="http://transpolitica.org/2015/04/02/democratic-intelligence/">available online</a>.

        To summarize, the main aim of this site is <i>@Html.ActionLink(Constants.Goal, "MainGoal")</i>, and the current subgoal, or stepping stone
        towards the main goal is <i>@Html.ActionLink(configuration.CurrentSubgoal, "Subgoal")</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need your help to achieve these goals, and you can help out by doing the following:

        <li>
            Learn, and @Html.ActionLink("take tests to increase your knowledge of the subjects on this site", "Details", "Tag").
            The first subject to learn is @Html.ActionLink("critical thinking", "Details", "Tag").  Once you have mastered it
